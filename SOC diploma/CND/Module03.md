# Access Control 
the slective restriction of access to an asset or system/network 

## Access Control terminologies 
- subject  
user or proccess that want to access a resource  
- Object  
theresource that user or process want ot access  
- monitor  
checks the access control rule 
- operation  
what the subject what to do

### Principles of access control: 
- speration of duties (SOD)
- need-to-know 
- principle of least privilege 

### Access Control models 
- Mandatory Acess control (MAC)
- Discretionary access control (DAC)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- RUle-base access control(RB-RVAC)

## The castel-and-moat model 
traditional approach of network security which focuses on restricting access to the network resource 

## Zero trust network model 
no one is trusted by default it enables strict identity and authnicate
