### example: software, system, people ,Data , servers 

## Threats 
a potential negative event that can cause damage to an asset 
### example: Steal sensitive data , cause server shutdown , employee to reveal senstive information 

### threat souces:
- natural: fires, floods, power failure
- intentional: unskilled admins , accidents 
- External: hackers , terrorists 

## threat Actors 
treat actor is an individual or group that breaks into the system to achieve specific goal 
### example 
- hacktivist 
- terrorists
- suicide hackers 
- state-sponsored hackers
- organized hackers 
- script kiddies 
- industrial spies 
- insider threat 

## vulnerability 
refers to the existence of weakness in an asset that can be exploited by the threat agents 
### causes of vulnerability 
- hardware or software misconfiguration 
- insecure or poor design of the network 
- inherent technology weaknesses 
- careless approach of end users 
#### technological
- TCP/IP protocol vulnerabilities 
- operating system vulnerabilities 
- network device vulnerabilities  
#### security policy 
- unwritten policy 
- lack of continuity 
- politics 
- lack of awareness 
#### configuration
- user account vulnerabilities 
- system account vulnerabilities 
- internet service misconfiguration 
- default password and settings 
- network device misconfiguration 

## Risk
risk refers to the potential loss or damage that can occur when a threat to an asset exists in the presence of a vulnerability that can be exploited 
### Example of Risks
- disruption or complete shutdown
- loss of privacy 
- legal liability 
- loss of productivity 
- Data loss/theft 

## ATTACK
is an action initiated for exploiting vulnerabilities 
> ATTACK = motive + metod + vulnerability

## Attackers Methodologirs & frameworks 
### Pre-ATT&CK 
1. reconnaissance
2. WEAPONIZE 
### ATT&CK  
2. Deliver
3. Exploit
4. Control
5. Execute
6. maintain 

## goal of network Defense 
- confidentiality
- intergrity
- availability
- authenticity
- non-Repudiation

## network Defense Benefits & challenges 
 
### benefits: 
- protect information assets 
- comply with government and industy specific regulations 
- ensure secure communication with cients and suppliers 
- reduce the risk of being attacks 
- gain competitive edge over competitior 

### challenges 
- distribute computing environments 
- Emerging threats 
- lack of network security skills 

## Network Security Approaches
- Preventive 
- Reactive
- Retrospective
- Proactive 

## Security Control 
### Administrative 
- regulatory framework 
- Employee monitoring 
- secuirty awareness
- seuciry policy
- information classification 
### technical 
- Access controls 
- authentication
- authorization
- auditing 
- security protocols
